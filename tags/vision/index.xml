      <description>&lt;p&gt;RootAbout.com is all about building tools. And it&amp;rsquo;s doing that slowly but surely starting off with a Admin Builder for WordPress admin panels, for developers. Other projects are in plan but nothing started yet. More about Admin Builder Here &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.rootabout.com/admin-builder&#34;&gt;Click here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tools have been around for ever, prooving their usefulness and making life easier. The tools built here have that exact purpose, to make things, easier, faster, cheaper, more efficient. IF they are , it&amp;rsquo;s up for you to decide. Tools may be a general description, but the purpose is focused, each tool is built to do it&amp;rsquo;s job as well as we can make it to. Feel free to judge and give feedback. Whenever, wherever.&lt;/p&gt;
